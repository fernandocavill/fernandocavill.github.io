what is it and where to use for

something like yes or no , 0-1 and can be multiclass problem


## linear regression not suits for classficiation

The reason is classification is always discrete value,but the linear regression may expand the boundary.

Logistic function  htx = g(tTx) 
gt = 1/1+e-z
somethign like [that](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/supplement/AqSH6/hypothesis-representation)

The *decision boundary* is the line that separates the area where y = 0 and where y = 1. It is created by our hypothesis function.
