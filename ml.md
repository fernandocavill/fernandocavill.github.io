# This is my note of machine learning 

This course link is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week), the famous one.

## My goal of this course

learning different kind of algorithms and how to apply them. no need to create new one.


## what is machine learning

A computer program is said to  learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P.

## Two major type of learning algorithms

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning


Supervised algorithm is we teach computer to learn.

Unsupervised is the computer teach itself.

## Supervised learning

The supervised learning could be categoried by "regression" and "classification" problem.

Regression Problem cares continues value,like a quadratic line.

Classfication prolbem cares about discrete value,like (0,1)
